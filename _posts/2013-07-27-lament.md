I am split between two worlds, O God

both war for my sexuality day and night

both filled with anger and confusion

both certain they hold the truth

The long and narrow path is rocky; lonely

my shoes don’t fit

I watch a friend attempt it

I cannot walk it for him

And yet, the view from here is beautiful

the freedom is exhilarating

the sun illuminates everything

the wind drowns the noise from below

Your faithfulness cannot be captured into moments

it is complete and perfect

it corrects my path gently

it is continually fulfilling the call you’ve placed on my life

And you will not let me go.
